# Approximation Algorithms for the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)

## 1. Project Description

This project implements and analyzes three algorithms for solving the **Euclidean** Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP): one exact (Brute Force) and two approximation (Double Tree & Christofides').

The goal is to solve given TSP instances, which are provided as adjacency matrix files. We compare the solution cost (total distance) and execution time of both algorithms against the known optimal value for each instance.

## 2. Algorithms Implemented

### 2.1. Exact Algorithm: Brute Force

* **Description:** Checks every possible permutation of vertices to find the guaranteed optimal tour.
* **Time Complexity:** $O(n(n!))$
* **Note:** Due to its factorial complexity, this algorithm is only feasible for very small instances (e.g., n < 12).

### 2.2. Approximation Algorithm: Double Tree Algorithm

* **Description:** A 2-approximation algorithm for metric TSPs. The implementation involves creating a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), creating an Eulerian circuit to find the Hamiltonian cycle.
* **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2(log(n)))$

### 2.3. Approximation Algorithm: Christofides' Algorithm

* **Description:** A 1.5-approximation algorithm for metric TSPs. The implementation involves creating a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), finding a minimum-weight perfect matching on the odd-degree vertices of the MST, and finally creating an Eulerian circuit to find the Hamiltonian cycle.
* **Time Complexity:** $O(n^3)$

## 4. Dependencies

To build and run this project, you will need:

* **CMake** (version 3.10 or higher)
* A C++ compiler supporting C++17 (e.g., **g++**, **Clang**)
* **Make** (or another build system like Ninja)

## 5. How to Build

Follow these steps to compile the project using CMake:

```bash
# 1. Get the code
git clone https://github.com/Eduardo-Machado-Behling/TSP-Algorithms.git
cd TSP-Algorithms

# 2. Configure the project
# This command generates the build system in the 'build/' directory
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# 3. Compile the project
cmake --build build

# The executable will be located at:
./bin/TSP
```

## 6. How to Run

The executable generates a `log.csv` file in the executable's folder (`./bin/`) and also prints results to the terminal. The log file stores data from each sample and run.

**Example `log.csv` Output:**

```csv
Sample,Algorithm,VertsAmount,ExecutionTime,Path,Cost,Expected,Delta
"tsp2_1248.txt","Christofides-Serdiyl.dll",6,9.04e-05,0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 0,1272,1248,24,
"tsp1_253.txt","Christofides-Serdiyl.dll",11,2.73e-05,0 -> 7 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 9 -> 6 -> 1 -> 10 -> 2 -> 8 -> 0,263,253,10,
...
```

**Note:**
The Brute Force algorithm will always run *last*. It will require user intervention (confirmation to run) for instances larger than `tsp3_1194.txt`, given that `tsp4_7013.txt` and `tsp5_27603.txt` are intractable with this O(n\!) algorithm.


### Usage

```bash
# Run from the root directory after building
./bin/TSP <number of runs per sample>

# Example: Run 5 times for each sample
./bin/TSP 5

# Example: Run 1 time (default)
./bin/TSP
```

| Path | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `./samples` | Hosts the input instance files (e.g. `tsp1_253.txt`). |
| `./src` | Hosts the main C++ source code that runs the algorithms. |
| `./include` | Hosts the header files for the source code. |
| `./lib` | Hosts the algorithm implementations. Each sub-folder is a **Shared Library CMake Project** that compiles to a `.dll` or `.so` file. |
| `./bin` | Output directory for the final `TSP` executable and `log.csv`. |
| `./build` | Build directory generated by CMake. |
